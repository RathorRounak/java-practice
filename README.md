Welcome to my Java Practice Repository!
This repo contains all the Java questions, exercises, and concept-based programs that I solve while learning and improving my Java skills.

The goal is simple:
✔ Practice consistently
✔ Improve problem-solving
✔ Understand OOP deeply
✔ Build strong backend foundations
